# Weather App

This weather application performs two tasks: 
* First, this app will show the Real time weather of your Current location.
* Second, it will show the Weather conditions of a particular city when you search the particular city.
* While making this app I learn all the basics in React.js such as Hooks, States, Props, Components, effects, API Call,     
  Dynamic data display, Dynamic fetch data, Working with forms,etc.
